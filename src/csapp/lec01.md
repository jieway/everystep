
1. 数字的表示及其属性。
2. 机器级编程。
3. 内存系统。


另一个我们将讨论相当多的，对于编程者相当直观的内容
It's aspects of the memory system so modern computers have a very complex
是内存系统的一些方面，所以现代计算机有一个非常复杂的
layered memory system to try give you to hight performance in high capacity at the same time
分层存储的系统，试图同时给你高性能的表现和较大的储存容量
And there's some results of that system that can mean that
使用这个系统的结果意味着
If you program write a program well it might work really well
如果你的程序编写得很好，它可能运行得很好
If you don't it could run very poorly because it's not making use of this hierarchical memory system
如果你不这样做，它可能会运行地非常糟糕，因为它没有利用这个分层存储系统
So and also there's a lot of bugs that show up especially in C programs
还有很多 bug 尤其是在 C 程序中出现
That have to do with memory referencing errors
这与内存引用错误有关
So understanding what those errors are what their manifestation is how to prevent them as a big part of the course
所以搞清楚这些错误是什么，他们的表现是什么，如何防止它们是课程的重要组成部分
So for example if I define a struct that contains a two integer values A in an array
因此，例如，如果我定义一个结构，其中 a 数组中包含两个整数值
And a double precision floating point number d
还有 d 一个双精度浮点数
And if I err this function fun() you'll see what it does is it's given an argument i
这个函数 fun( )，你会发现它的功能是给定一个参数 i
And it sets the element of a to some strange-looking value
它将 a 的元素设置为一些奇怪的值
So as you know I should really only be either 0 or 1 with this code
你知道 i 应该只能是 0 或 1
Because that's the range of possible values of this array a
因为这是数组 a 的值的可能范围
But we can try other things too so...
但我们也可以尝试其他的东西 ......
In particular if you run it on either one or two you'll get what you'd expect
就像第一行或第二行那样运行程序，你会得到你所期望的
That you assigned a 3.14 to element d of this structure
你给这个结构的元素 d 分配了 3.14
And when you read it back you get the same thing
当你读回来时，你会得到同样的结果
And in fact but now if I set a of two to this number
事实上，但现在如果我将这两个数字设置为这个数字 2
All of a sudden you'll see that my floating number which
突然之间，你会看到我的浮点数
seems to have nothing to do with a has changed
一个似乎与 a 无关的值发生了改变
And if I do that same thing with...
如果我做同样的事情 ......
I equal to three you'll see I get a number that's closer to two than to 3.14
i 等于 3，你会看到我得到的数字接近于 2，而不是 3.14
And if I keep going
如果我继续进行下去
Well nothing much happens util I hit (fun)(6) and then the program crashes
那么不会发生其他的变化，直到我调用 fun(6)，然后程序崩溃
So something interesting is going on here at least something quirky is going on
所以发生了一些有趣的事情，至少是一些奇怪的事情
And the reason is again it has to do with how data is laid out in memory and
原因也与数据如何在内存中布局有关
How its accessed and one of the features of C and C++
内存是如何访问的，和 C 和 C++ 的特性之一
It doesn't do any bounds checking on a race it will happily let you reference
它不会在运行中做任何边界检查，它会很乐意让你访问
element number five million of a two element array and not complain
元素下标为 500 万的仅有一或两个元素的数组，而不是抱怨
But the operating system might complain as it did here
但操作系统可能会抱怨，因为它（访问越界）发生在这里面
And it in this particular structure and we'll see more about how structures are implemented and weighed out
而且，在这个特定的结构中，我们将更多地了解结构是如何实现和排列的
But basically the two if each of these uh blocks in this vertical chain represents four bytes
对于最下面的两个元素，垂直链中每个块代表 4 字节
So the two elements of a each are four bytes
所以 a 的两个元素都是四个字节
D is eight bytes and then there's some other stuff in the other beyond them
d 是八个字节，然后在它上面，此结构体与其它结构之间还有一些其他的东西
That's not actually in the structured zone
并不在结构区域内部
So you'll see that if I reference either a[0] or a[1]
所以你会看到，如果我引用 a[0] 或者 a[1]
Then I will just modify that array as designed
然后我会按照设计好的修改该数组
But when I'm calling fun(2) or fun(3)
但是当我调用 fun(2) 或者 fun(3)
What I'm actually doing is altering the bytes that encode this number 'd'
我实际上做的是改变这个浮点数 d 的字节
And that's why you saw the sort of funny numbers come out it
这就是为什么你看到这种有趣的数字出来
And then I go up at some point when I hit 6
当我上升中遇到了某个点，当输入 6 时
I'm modifying some state of the program that
我修改了该程序的某些状态
It's using to kind of keep things organized most likely how it keeps track of allocated memory
它被用于维持程序运行，最有可能是记录已经分配的内存
And that's causing the program to crash
这就导致了程序崩溃
So this is a pretty good demonstration of a why C programming can drive you crazy
所以这是一个很好的演示，说明为什么 C 编程会让你疯狂
Because as you saw it doesn't do bounds checking so it's easy to write code that does invalid stuff
因为正如你所看到的那样，它不会执行边界检查，所以很容易编写出非法的代码
It's also often the case that you'll cause some problem and it has a sort of action a distance feature that
通常情况下，你会导致一些问题，这些问题拥有一种远距离的特性
You can modify some think you're modifying some data structure
你认为是对某个数据结构进行了修改
And what you're doing because of the way things are organized in memory
而你这样做的原因是因为事物在内存中的排列方式
You're changing something totally unrelated somewhere else in the program
其实你改变了与程序中，某个其他地方的完全无关的东西
You'd imagine they're not just one apart but they're 10,000 apart
你可以想象它们不只是分开了，而且它们相隔万里
And things might just run fine for hours days or weeks
而且可能会在几天或几周内程序运行良好
And then always say at some point that data that got corrupted
然后总是说在某些时候数据被损坏了
A long time ago gets accessed and something goes wrong
很久以前被访问并且产生错误
So this can be some of the worst nightmare debugging nightmares
所以这可能是最可怕的调试噩梦
that exists on earth is to try and figure out memory referencing errors
在地球上存在的最可怕的噩梦，是试图找出内存引用错误
So this is actually one argument not to program in C or C++
所以这实际上是一个不要用 C 或 C++ 编程的辩论的论据
And it's a valid argument all admitted
这是一个有效的论据，我承认
But also as a person who's right in a lot of C programming
而且作为一个在很多 C 编程中都是正确的人
You just get more experienced and you know at times that you should actually put bounds checking in your own code
你只是得到更多的经验，你知道有时你应该在你自己的代码中进行边界检查
And there's also tools available that will help you sort of bullet proof your code
还有一些工具可以帮助你对代码进行「防弹测试」
So that it will detect these kind of problems
它会检测到这些问题
So it's not like you have to change languages but it is a particular feature of these languages
所以你不必改变编程的语言，这些缺点是这些语言的一个特点
So understanding sort of the machine-level representation of data structures how they work really make a huge difference
因此，理解数据结构的机器级别表示以及它们如何运行对于
in your ability to deal with these kind of vulnerabilities
你处理这些漏洞的能力十分重要
Vulnerabilities by the way also from a security perspective
漏洞，是从安全角度来看待的
The fourth sort of theme we'll cover in the courses getting performance out of programs
课程的第四个主题是，从程序角度增加它们的性能
Other parts of the curriculum in CS
CS 中课程的其他部分
do much more emphasis on getting the right algorithm at the right data structure
更多地强调在正确的数据结构中获得正确的算法
And that's really well and good it's important stuff I don't deny it
这真的很好，很重要，我不否认它
But they some amount of the sort of low-level optimization that you need to do
但是他们之中某些需要进行一些低级别的优化
That you need to understand what the system does
你需要了解系统的运行规律
What makes it run well what makes it run poorly
是什么让它运行得很好，是什么让它运行不佳
In order to be able to do that kind of optimization
为了能够做到这种优化
So the example we like to use is
所以我们喜欢使用的例子是
These two functions do exactly the same thing in terms of their...their behavior
这两个函数在他们的行为方面完全一样
What they do is copy a matrix or array from called source 'src' to a destination 'dst'
他们所做的是将一个矩阵或数组从源地址 src 复制到目标地址 dst
They're both size to be 2048 rows 2048 columns two-dimensional arrays
它们的大小都是 2048 行 2048 列的二维数组
And you'll see that the program's do the obvious thing you have a nested pair of loops to do the row and column indices
你会看到程序做了显而易见的事情，你有一对嵌套的循环来做行列索引
And you just copy from one source element to a destination element
而你只需从一个一个将源地址元素复制到目标地址的元素
The only thing that's different you'll see is that the two loops
唯一不同的是，这两个循环
Their nesting is different the nesting order is different
它们的嵌套顺序不同，嵌套顺序不同
One case I'm going kind of row first
有一种情况我会，行优先
going through all the rows and then the columns and the other is for any given row
外循环遍历行，内循环遍历列。另一种是先遍历列，再遍历行拷贝
I'm copying all the columns that's really the only difference between these two programs
这是两个程序之间唯一的区别
But what you'll find if you run it on a typical system
但是如果你在普通的系统上运行它，你会发现
It's that one is much faster than the other
第一个比另一个快得多
In this particular machine we ran it on it was about close to 20 times difference in performance
在这台特定的机器上，我们运行它的性能差不多有 20 倍
So something fishy is going on if the same program that differs only in this seemingly insignificant way
仅有这种看似不痛不痒的区别，两个完全相同的程序，运行起来却发生了相当诡异的事情
A way that has no effect whatsoever on its functionality can have this much performance difference
一种对其功能没有任何影响的修改，可以产生这么大的性能差异
And so to understand this you need to stare at the cover of the book
所以要了解这一点，你需要盯着书的封面
Because basically you're two different points of this strange-looking picture that's on your book
因为基本上你是在书上这张奇怪图片的两个不同点
And since there's no axis or labels on it it makes no sense whatsoever
由于封面图没有轴或单位，所以它没有任何意义
But it's there
但它在那里
So what you see is this picture shows four different memory access patterns I won't go into the details
你看到的是这张图片显示了四种不同的内存访问模式，我在这里不会详细讨论
What the throughput measured in megabytes per second on basically a copying program was
基本上复制程序的吞吐量是以兆字节/秒为单位的
And without going into the details what you'll see is
不深入细节，你看到的是
These two functions sort of sit at different points in this memory access pattern
这两个函数在这个内存访问模式中位于不同的位置
The one that goes through a row by row is much better than the one that goes through column by column
一行接一行方法比一列接一列的访问方法要好得多
And as a result you're getting a lot better performance and it has to do with this memory hierarchy and what they call the cache memories
结果是，你获得了更好的性能，它和内存层次结构中的缓存有关
That you're getting way better performance out of it in one case than the other
在某种情况下你获得了比其他方式性能高得多的方法
So that's explains what the cover of the book is about
所以这就解释了本书封面的内容
We'll talk about it more later in the course
我们稍后会在课程中深入讨论它
And then a final part of the course talks more about not just getting computers to run little programs in isolation
然后，课程的最后一部分将更多地讨论不仅让计算机孤立运行小程序
But getting computers that talk to each other over networks implement services like web servers
而且能够通过网络获取彼此交谈，实现像 Web 服务器这样的服务
And other functions like that which of course is where most of the world of computing sits today
和其他功能，就像目前世界上大多数计算机一样
It's not just isolated machines but computers they internet with each other over the networks
它不仅仅是孤立的机器，而是通过网络彼此互联的计算机
They're embedded controllers that are interacting with the physical world
它们是与物理世界交互的嵌入式控制器
So really the the world of computers is a much richer environment
所以电脑世界真的是一个更加丰富的环境
And we'll cover at least some aspects of that in the final part of this course
我们将在本课程的最后部分稍微介绍一点那些方面
So as I mentioned the other feature of this course
所以我提到了这门课的另一个特点
It will get you ready for other systems courses you might take  at CMU
它将帮助你做好你可能在 CMU 学习的其他系统性课程的准备
And here we've listed actually a subset of the courses at the university that require this course is a prerequisite
在这里，我们已经列出了大学中需要本课程作为基础的一部分课程
And they're mostly in computer science and ECE
他们主要是计算机科学和电子计算机工程课程
But you'll see it's quite a range of different courses
但是你会看到这是一系列不同的课程
And each of them builds on to one or multiple aspects of the material you learn in the course
并且它们每一个都基于你在课程中学习的内容的一个或多个方面
So the reason why we make everyone take this course including incoming master's students
所以这就是我们为什么要让每个人都参加这门课程，包括刚入学的硕士生
It's that all these other courses at the university have come to rely on students being familiar
就是这所大学的其他所有课程都依赖于学生熟悉本课程
and having done the work of 213 or 513 as a prerequisite
和 213 或 513 课程为前提
And they can build on that material and sort of cover more ground as a result rather than having to do
而且它们可以基于内容进行深入，并覆盖更多领域，而不是面面俱到
What would otherwise be somewhat remedial work on it
这些内容需要额外地工作来补充
And in fact one of the part of the genesis of this course was the people who taught the operating system course a 410
事实上，这门课的一部分发起人来自操作系统课程 410
Sort of complained that they were spending too much time at the beginning of the course talking about some very basics of machine programming
他们抱怨说，他们在课程开始时，花费太多时间讨论一些非常基本的机器编程
And Dave and I said oh well we can cover that
Dave 和我说，那好我们来教这部分
So that was part of what got this course started
所以这是这门课程开始的起源部分
I mentioned that the course has a sort of perspective that's very different from traditional systems course
此课程有一种与传统系统性课程非常不同的观点
Most systems courses including that whole array you saw there
大多数系统课程包括你在那里看到的整个课时列表
we're about how do I build some particular feature,how do I implement an operating system
我们关注于如何构建一些特定功能，如何实现操作系统
How do I design a pipeline microprocessor?
我如何设计流水线微处理器？
And those it's all important stuff to know
那些都是重要的知识
We really want the people who are out there building operating systems and designing microprocessors to learn how to do it
我们真的希望那些致力于建立操作系统和设计微处理器的人学习如何去做它
On the other hand is a way to sort of get new into this and get the introduction and get the experience
另一种方法是向介绍这些新东西给学生，让学生接触使用它们，并获得经验
We find it more useful to take what we call a programmers perspective
我们发现采用我们所谓的程序员视角更有用
meaning understanding what you as a person who sits in front of a computer screen types code
意思是作为一个坐在电脑屏幕前输入代码的程序员去理解
I need to know about that machine you're typing code for in order to be effective at doing it
为了执行有效的操作，你需要了解你正在输入代码的机器
As opposed to somebody who some day going to be designing the the actual machine itself
和那些有一天会去设计真正的机器本身的人不同
So that by taking that perspective it gives you sort of an understanding
所以通过遵守这种观点，它给你一种见解
So now when you go off to implement it you'll actually know what these features are
所以现在当你着手去实现某种功能时，你会知道计算机的特性是什么
Why it's important to implement them well
为什么很好地依据计算机特性很重要
But also that's by doing this programmers perspective
与此同时，通过这个程序员的视角
It lets you right away get tools that you can use in other places
它立即让你获得可以在其他地方会用到的工具
Where you're writing programs are doing anything related to it and be more effective at that
编写程序或者是任何相关的工作，会使得它们更有效
So this programmers perspective really gives this this dual benefit to it
所以这个程序员的观点确实给了它这个双重好处
We feel is very useful and students who've taken the course in the past have expressed that as well
我们觉得这很有用，而过去参加过这项课程的学生也表示了这一点
So as I mentioned we have two instructors for the course
所以正如我所提到的，这个课程我们有两名讲师
And they also happen to be authors
他们也碰巧是作者
The longest,we've probably taught this course more than anyone else
我们应该是教授这门课时间最长的讲师了
 But it's also taught by other people on campus as well
但它同时也由校内其他人讲授
So what I'm going to do now is hand my pair of microphones over to Dave
所以我现在要做的是把麦克风交给Dave
All right welcome good afternoon it's great to see you
好的，下午好，很高兴见到你们
My name is Dave O'Halloran
我叫 Dave O'Halloran
And I'm just delighted to have the opportunity to be one of your instructors this term
而且我很高兴有机会成为你这个学期的导师之一
This course is one of the reason I'm so excited to be teaching
这门课是我对于教学很兴奋的原因之一
I just love this course
我只是非常喜欢这个课程
The real the reason is the the opportunity of represents to have an impact on people's lives
真正的原因是它具有对人的一生产生影响的机会
We really believe that the material you learned this semester
我们真的相信你在这个学期学到的知识
can have a really positive and long-lasting impact on on your careers
可以对你的事业产生真正的积极和持久的影响
And it'll help you not only with your future classes but also future positions you have
它不仅可以帮助你学习未来的课程，还可以帮助你掌握未来的职位
And I hear this from people all all the time from CMU students
我总是从 CMU 的学生那里听到这种反馈
Students around the world who have taken the equivalent of 213 it at their schools
从世界各地在他们学校已经接受了等同于 213 课程的学生口中
I even though a couple years ago we were interviewing a faculty member tenure tenure-track faculty member
即使在几年前，当我们正在面试一位终身教授
Who went to did his undergrad at CMU
他是在 CMU 就读的本科
And then went off to Stanford got his PhD at Stanford and was coming back to you know join the faculty
然后去斯坦福大学获得他在斯坦福大学的博士学位，并回到这里的系就职
And he told me that 213 changed his life in our interview
他在面试中告诉我，213 改变了他的生活
Now I don't know if he was trying to butter me up
现在我不知道他是否故意想要让我高兴
But I think I believe him
但我相信他
He said it changed his whole life in the sense that it gave him a research direction
他说这改变了他的整个生活，因为它给了他一个研究方向
You know he didn't really know what he knew it kind of like computer science but it didn't really know what direction to go
他过去并不真正知道什么是计算机科学，并不知道要走什么方向
After he took 213 he knew they wanted to to do his work was life's work in systems
在他上 213 之后，他知道他的人生目标工作是计算机系统
Now it was just remarkable right to come down and tap we ended up actually hiring him
现在，他认为选择计算机底层是很正确的选择，我们最终聘请了他
He told me that everybody in his lab at Stanford all of the grad students had a copy of the book on their desk
他告诉我，在他斯坦福大学的实验室里，每个研究生都在他们的办公桌上放了这本书
From and they were from all over you know all different schools
他们都来自不同的学校
And so I mean I even I was in a bookstore in Beijing a couple years ago right outside the PKU campus
我几年前进入北京一家书店，就在北大校园外面
I was up on the fifth floor trying to see if I could find a copy of the textbook
我在五楼想看看是否可以找到这本书
And I found the English version in one aisle
然后我在一个通道里找到了英文版本
And then a couple aisles over I found the Chinese version
接着我在相隔几个过道远的地方找到了中文版
I was going through the Chinese version and this guy taps me on my shoulder
我正在浏览中文版本，有个人在我的肩上拍了一下
And I turned around,he says oh man that that book is really good you should the English version is 2 aisles over
我转过身来，他说哦哥们，那本书真的很好，你应该看英文原版，离这里两个过道远
And I mean it just blew me away to be to be in the head of someone like
它戳破了我以为我会被读者牢记住的想法
halfway around the world it was just that it was just one of those moments
在世界各地的中途，它只是那些时刻之一
So I'm not trying to boast, I'm just trying what I want I want to give you the sense of
所以我不想吹牛，我只是想尝试给你我的感受
What it what an opportunity this course represents for Randal and I to to have
这个课程对 Randy 和我来说有什么样的可能
What we hope will be a really positive impact on on your lives
我们希望对你的人生产生真正的积极影响
So let me we have kind of a kind of a funny organization for the course
我们这个课程有个很有趣的课程安排
in response to that just the the tremendous demand we have we found that we have for it
为了应对巨大的需求，我们发现我们有这个需求
So there's there's actually three course numbers but it's all the same course
所以实际上有三个课程号码，但它们都是相同的课程
It's the identical course 513, 15-513 is for our master students
这是相同的课程 513, 15-513 是针对我们的硕士生
And the 15-513 doesn't have a formal lecture so there's no seats assigned to it
而 15-513 没有正式的面授课，所以没有分配座位
It instead we'll videotape the lectures
相反，我们会录制讲座
And e'll make those available on the course web web page for our graduate students
并且，我们会在研究生的课程网页上提供这些录像
The reason we do this is just because in the past well we didn't have enough seats for everyone
我们这样做的原因是因为在过去，我们没有足够的席位给每个人
And there would be cases where there might be a hundred 150 master students on the waitlist
而且有些情况下，可能会有一百名 150 名硕士生在候课名单上
They wouldn't be able to get into the course
他们无法参加这个课程
We didn't really want that because they need this course for to take other courses
我们不想这样，因为他们需要这门课来参加其他课程
So that's the reason why we have this this sort of does not need version of 213, 513
所以这就是为什么我们有这种累赘的 213, 513 两个版本的原因
Because we can admit as many all the master's students that that need to take the course
因为我们可以接收所有需要上这门课的硕士生
Now 15-213 and 18-213 or are for undergraduates in computer science and ECE respectively
现在 15-213 和 18-213 分别是针对计算机科学和电子计算机工程的本科生
The undergraduates will go to lectures and recitations okay in person graduate students will watch videotapes of those
本科生将去上课，研究生会看这些录像带
But otherwise,yes
但是，从另一方面，好的
[students speaking]
[学生发言]
Yeah we're making them available to everyone actually
是的，我们正在将它们提供给每个人
Sorry?
什么？
And lecture slides as well everything's available on the course web page
和演讲幻灯片的所有内容都会在课程网站上提供
So you'll be doing
所以你会做
The all of students will have equal access to office hours,
所有的学生将有平等的访问办公室时间，
the staff mailing list and everybody does the same labs and the same exams
员工邮件列表和每个人都做同样的实验作业和相同的考试
Okay so it's just a question it's just a matter of whether you're good a lecture in person or if you watch it on video
好吧，这只是一个你是善于听讲座，还是在视频中观看的问题
In fact if you know since it's available to everybody if you miss lecture it'll be there
事实上，如果你错过讲座的话，每个人都可以在网页上找到它
on the webpage you can catch up which I know you'll probably do
在网页上你可以跟上进度，我想你们很可能要这样做
Actually I know most of you will never miss class
其实我知道你们大部分人都不会翘课
Right, but the few of you who do now you'll be able to watch the video
但现在你们中的极少数人会，他们可以看视频
Okay.All right this is the one part,this part I hate
好吧，这一部分是我讨厌的部分
I love teaching that this is the one part teaching that
我喜欢教学，但是不包括这部分
None of us really like.But we have to talk about it and that's academic integrity
我们没有人真的喜欢。但我们必须提起它，那就是学术诚信
If you're new on campus coming from a international school
如果你是来自国际地区学校的校园新生
If you're an international student new on campus
如果你是新的国际学生
There might be different notions of academic integrity
学术诚信可能有不同的概念
And different notions of cheating at your undergraduate school your old school
和你的本校在你的旧学校作弊的不同概念
So if you're new on campus pay very close attention to this
所以，如果你是校园新人，就要非常注意这一点
Because at Carnegie Mellon we take academic integrity very seriously
因为在卡内基梅隆，我们非常重视学术诚信
Okay it's not a wink wink nod nod, we're very serious about it
好吧，这不是一个眨眼点头的话题，我们对此非常认真
We want everybody doing their own work to preserve the integrity of the courses
我们希望每个人都独自完成作业，以保持课程的品质
So what exactly is cheating?
那么究竟是什么作弊？
So if you share code with anybody
所以，如果你与任何人分享代码
either copying, retyping, if looking at somebody's code like, if you look at somebody's code on the screen
无论是复制，重新输入，查看某人的代码，例如你看屏幕上的某个人的代码
Or if you give somebody a file
或者如果你给某人一个文件
All of those,all of those examples of sharing are cheating
所有这些，所有这些和他人分享的例子都是作弊
If you describe your code like line by line to somebody that's cheating
如果你逐行描述你的代码给别人，是作弊
If you coach somebody line by line that's cheating
如果你指导某人一行一行写代码，是作弊
Searching the web for solutions just the act of searching is cheating
搜索网络上的解决方案，仅是搜索的行为，也是作弊
This is a real problem for us in particular
这对我们来说尤其是一个实际的问题
Because the course is I offered all around the world and
因为课程是我向全世界提供的
People either maliciously or or sometimes just they're proud of their work
人们无论是恶意传播，或是他们有时只是为自己的成果感到自豪
And they post it you know for employers on like public github sites
他们会在类似的公共网站例如 Github 上发布成果，并展示给招聘者
So it might be tempting to to search for these solutions
因此，寻找这些解决方案可能很诱人
But even the act of searching is cheating
但即使是搜寻的行为也是作弊
And definitely if you find some a solution in and use it.That's cheating
当然，如果你找到一些解决方案并使用它，那就是作弊
Even if you modify it afterwards
即使你之后修改它
And I just want you to remember I know how to use Google just as well as anybody else right
我只想让你记住我知道和其他人一样也会用 Google
So I can search for solutions too
所以我也可以搜索解决方案
So copying code you know you might be tempted to copy code from someone who took the class you know in a previous semester
因此，你复制的代码可能在之前的课中已经被某人复制并使用过了
Don't do it,that's that's cheating too
不要这样做，那也是作弊
Now what's not cheating?
那什么不是作弊？
So you can help each other use tools

And then for the the latter four labs which are much more intense we're going to allow you to a max of two grades days
然后对于后面更困难的实验室作业，我们将允许你最多两个宽限日
And the reason we're doing this is because we don't want you to burn your grade these grace days are valuable
而我们这样做的原因是因为我们不希望你们丢掉成绩，这些宽限日是很有价值的
They're critical especially later in the semester when it have you really dizzy

但是，人们往往不注意，但
just they're unable to but but really you for every one of these assignments you want to start early
只是他们无法做到，但实际上你对于你想要尽早开始的每一项任务都是如此
And the reason is you need to give yourself time to to go seek help if you get stuck
原因是你需要给自己时间去寻求帮助，如果你卡住了
 Because the nature of these very programming intensive assignments like we have in 213 is that you're going to get stuck
因为这些编程十分密集型任务的性质就决定，像 213 中那样，你会陷入困境
And often it's very hard to to bound the time you spend on on some of these assignments

The kicker is that we restrict the set of operators that you can use
异常条件是，是我们限制你可以使用的运算符类型
And it has to be straight line code no conditionals or loops

So to solve these puzzles
所以解决这些难题
So imagine how you might try to solve absolute value without using an if statement
所以想象一下，如果不使用 if 语句，你如何尝试解决绝对值问题
The normal way to do it would be if X less than 0 return X or negative X
正常的做法是如果 X 小于 0 则返回负 X 否则是 X
See I told you we make mistakes
我告诉你我们犯了错误
But imagine how you might do that without using conditionals and only using bit levels C operations
但想象一下，如果不使用条件并仅使用位级 C 操作，你可能会这样做
Right so this is how this is our way of teaching you how data is really represented in the machine
对，这就是我们如何教导你如何在机器中表现数据的方式
Now the bomblab which you've probably heard at this is

If you type in the what it wants you to type what it expects you type
如果你输入了它想要你去输入的内容
Then you've diffused that phase and it goes to the next phase
然后，你已经拆解了这一阶段的炸弹，并进入下一个阶段
Then you have to type what that phase
然后你必须输入那个阶段要求的输入
And if you defuse all the phases then you've diffused the bomb
如果你化解所有阶段，那么你已经解除了炸弹
However if you type in the wrong thing then the bomb explodes by printing boom
然而，如果你输入错误的东西，那么炸弹就会通过打印 BOOM 而爆炸
And you have to try it again
你必须再试一次
And the kicker is in either case when if you explode the bomb
异常条件是，任意条件下如果爆炸炸弹
Or defuse a phase that information gets sent to auto lab
或者成功拆解，信息都会被发送到 auto lab
If you exit and we use the defusing string that that your bomb sends us
如果你退出了，我们使用你的炸弹发送给我们的字符串
And we check it out on a copy of your bomb that we keep on the server
我们检查一下你的炸弹，并把副本保存在服务器上
That's another thing every everybody gets a different bomb slightly different bomb
另一件事是每个人都得到一个不同的炸弹，略有不同的炸弹
So we check so when you defuse when you defuse a phase the auto lab takes the string that
所以我们检查，当你通过一个阶段时，自动实验室会检查炸弹发来的字符串，
that your bomb sends us and then compares against the local copy of your bomb
然后与你的炸弹本地副本进行比较
If you explode phase you lose half a point
如果你引爆了炸弹，你失去了半点分数
So there's a real consequence to exploding your bomb it's very very tense right
所以炸弹爆炸的真正后果是非常紧张的
Until you learn how to use GDB to set a breakpoint
直到你学习如何使用 GDB 设置断点
Before the function that sends the information to the server
在将信息发送到服务器的功能之前
And we want you to do that right
我们希望你做对了
So a bombs are really the bombs really beautiful it's kind of fun it's kind of like a video game
所以炸弹真的非常漂亮，炸弹很有趣，就像电子游戏一样
It teaches you how to read compiler generated code
它教你如何阅读编译器生成的代码
Because the only oh the kicker is sorry that
因为唯一的 ... 哦，异常条件没说，对不起
The kicker is we don't give you the source code all we give you is the binary the binary bomb
异常条件是我们不给你源代码，我们给你的只是二进制的二进制炸弹
So in order to defuse a bomb you've got to fire up gdb
所以为了化解炸弹，你必须启动 GDB
Single trace through the find where the code is for each phase single trace through that code
单步调试直到找到每一阶段的代码
And sort of reverse engineer and figure out what it wants you to type in
然后逆向编译，找出它想要你输入的内容
And then you'll quickly find out where that function that explodes the bomb is  and you'll put a breakpoint there
然后你会很快发现爆炸炸弹的功能在哪里，你会在那里放置一个断点
And so we want you to do that because
所以我们希望你这样做，因为
The bomb besides teaching you how to program assembly language  it also teaches you sort of organically how to use gdb
除了教你如何编程汇编语言之外，它还教你如何有机地使用 GDB
Because you really can't do it if you don't use if you don't run gdb
因为如果你不运行 GDB，你真的不能完成它
And then the the third lab is this is a new lab
然后第三个实验是这是一个新的实验
This semester the randy's develops called the attack lab
这个学期 Randy 发明的被称为攻击实验室的东西
And we developed this lab specifically for 64-bit architecture
我们专门为 64 位体系结构开发了这个实验
So this is a reflection of the change from 32 bits to 64 bits
所以这反映了从 32 位到 64 位的变化
And this is so we're really excited about this one you'll learn how to
这就是为什么我们对你将学习如何的这些感到非常兴奋
You'll learn how to write exploits using return to a sort of a modern technique called return to return oriented programming
你将学习如何编写漏洞，利用返回到一种称为返回到返回导向编程的现代技术
Which is kind of the modern modern way that hackers deal with the fact that stacks in newer machines move around
这是一种十分现代的方式，黑客是这样处理新型计算机中栈位置不固定，而且
And prohibitive and make it impossible to execute code on the on the stack
而且禁止，也不可能在栈上执行代码的事实
So this is a brand new labs really I think it's really going to be really going to be neat
所以这是一个全新的实验，我认为它确实会很清晰
In the memory hierarchy when we study the memory hierarchy
在我们研究内存层次结构时，在内存层次结构中
We have a cache lab called the cache lab
我们有一个名为缓存实验的实验
Where you'll build your own cache simulator
你会在哪里建立你自己的缓存模拟器
So this is how sort of learn how this hardware that Randy was mentioning called cache memory works
所以这用于学习被 Randy 称作高速缓冲存储器的这种硬件的工作原理
You'll build a simulator and see for that
你会建立一个模拟器并查看
And then you'll take a small transpose function
然后你会使用一个小的转置功能
And you'll try to make that that code run with as few misses as possible on your simulator
你会试着让你的代码在你的模拟器上运行时产生尽可能少的不命中
And this will involve sort of understanding of how the memory hierarchy works and how to exploit it
这将涉及到对内存层次结构如何工作的以及如何利用它的理解
The part of the course where you we sort of transition from hardware
这一部分课程是你从硬件转换到
to interacting with the system software that the operating system
与系统级软件、操作系统进行交互
There's sort of a concept that we call exceptional control flow that exists in all parts of the system
有一种概念，我们称之为异常控制流，存在于系统的所有部分
And it sort of represents that intellectual transition from hardware to software
这代表着从硬件到软件的智能转变
So this is how this was sort of a key idea that allowed us to kind of smoothly
所以这就是这样一个关键的想法，让我们能够顺利进行
move from from hardware to software in some intellectually consistent way
以一种智能一致的方式从硬件转向软件
And so the idea is that you cover an exceptional control flow like low hard, low-level hardware interrupts and exceptions
这个想法是，你了解了一种特殊的控制流程，如低级别的硬件中断和异常
And then at the higher level sort of involving hardware and operating system software
然后在更高层次的操作涉及硬件和操作系统软件
is the idea of an operate of a process context switch
其实是操作进程上下文切换的想法
So this is this is where you start to learn what processes are
所以这时你就开始了解了进程是什么
and how to ask the kernel to create and manage processes for you
以及如何让内核为你创建和管理进程
At the next higher level or a software form of exceptional control flow called a signal
在一个更高级别上，以软件形式的异常控制流被称作信号
So this exists solely on the Linux kernel
所以这只存在于 Linux 内核上
And then and then even at a higher level at there's an application C language
然后，甚至在更高层次上有一个应用程序的 C 语言
version of exceptional control flow call set jump and long jump
版本的异常控制流调用，被称作固定转移和远距离转移
So this this notion of exceptional control flow kind of exists
所以这种异常控制流的概念存在
in all parts of the system we covered all at once
在系统的所有部分，我们一次覆盖全部
And the lab that we use  to sort of exercise all these ideas is called the shell lab
我们用来练习所有这些想法的实验被称为 Shell 实验
In the shell lab you'll write your own linux shell which is really cool
在 Shell 实验中，你将编写你自己的 Linux Shell，这真的很酷
So that's the program the command line program that you interact with whenever you login a Linux box
所以，这就是你无论何时登录到 Linux 机器时，与其交互就要用到的命令行程序
You're going to write your own
你会写你自己的版本
I don't look for me that was really exciting when I could like write something that looked like a real shell
对我来说，当我看到一个看起来像真正的 Shell 的结果时，我真的很激动
It was pretty
这很漂亮
The next area is well study is called virtual memory
下一个领域是，研究被称为虚拟内存
Virtual memory is a sort of combination of hardware and software
虚拟内存是硬件和软件的组合
That presents an abstraction to you of this very of memory is a very large array of bytes
对你可见的抽象形状，内存好像是一个庞大的字节数组
When in reality memory is a hierarchy of hardware and of cache memories and DRAMs
实际上，存储器是硬件和高速缓冲存储器和 DRAM 的层次结构
Virtual memory provides a very high-level abstraction as just a linear sequence of bytes
虚拟内存提供了非常高级的抽象，使其成为线性字节序的结构
It also does provide a lot of a lot of other useful abstractions
它也提供了很多其他有用的抽象
That make many different parts of the system much easier to manage
这使得系统的许多不同部分更容易管理
Ok so we'll learn will learn about virtual memory,we'll learn how it works
好吧，我们将学习到虚拟内存，我们将学习它的工作原理
We'll learn about the performance impact potential performance impact that has on your programs
我们将了解你的程序中可能对性能造成潜在影响的部分
And we'll also learn how to manage that large pool of memory that it makes available to you
我们还将学习如何管理它提供给你的大量内存
And the lab that we do that the lab where you'll do that is called malloc lab
你要做的实验叫做 Malloc Lab
 And in the malloc lab you'll write your own malloc and free functions
在 Malloc Lab 中，你将编写自己的 Malloc 和 Free 函数
You'll reimplementation the functionally of the lib C malloc and free
你会重新实现 C 标准库中的 Malloc 和 Free
And this is a...
这是一个...
Maybe a maybe it's two pages of code
也许可能是两页代码
But it'll be a guarantee it'll be the most sophisticated difficult two pages of code you've written
但我保证，它将成为你编写的最复杂难懂的两页代码
Not only because since it's managing the memory system you can't use all of
不仅因为它是在管理内存系统，你不能使用全部内存
I mean C doesn't have many C doesn't help you out a lot with abstractions for data structures
我的意思是 C 不会帮你实现很多抽象数据结构
But when you're writing but at least it does give you ideas like struct unions
但是，当你写代码时，至少它会给你像结构、联合体的某些知识
You can use to structure your memory
你可以用来构建你的内存结构
When you're writing a malloc package you can't use any of those
当你写一个 Malloc 包时，你不能使用任何其他东西
 You have to write exclusively on pointers and casting
你必须专门写指针和类型转换
Because you malloc package is working at such a low level
因为你的 Malloc 包工作在十分低的底层
So it's a very difficult piece of code for that reason
所以这将是一个非常困难的代码
But also the design space for malloc is is enormous
但是 Malloc 的设计空间也是巨大的
You have many options they all have implications
你有许多选项，他们都有影响
That trade-off performance and memory efficiency
你需要在内存性能和内存效率之中平衡
And finally in the last part of the course
最后在课程的最后部分
We deal with I/O input/output
我们处理 I/O 输入/输出
Do far in the course we've just talked about sort of running programs on machines
在到此为止的课程中我们已经讨论了正在机器上运行的程序
In the last part of the course we'll talk about input and output  sending data into and out of the machine
在课程的最后部分，我们将讨论输入和输出，将数据发送到机器和从机器输出
So we'll look at basic concepts of Linux I/O
我们会了解 Linux I/O 的基本概念
And since I think the most interesting form of I/O is networking
我认为最有趣的 I/O 形式是网络
Which allows you to talk to machines anywhere in the world using the internet

Which is the basic interface for the internet to talk to machines any potentially any machine in the world
这是互联网与世界上任何可交互的机器交流的基本界面
 And that's really exciting
这真的很令人兴奋
I mean once I can still remember when developing this course I had two windows open on my machine
我的意思是，我还记得开发这门课时，我的机器上有两个窗口
I was SSH into two different machines
我用 SSH 进入了两台不同的机器
And I wrote a program to send a message like 'hello world' from one machine to the other
而且我编写了一个程序，将一个消息如 “Hello World” 从一台机器发送到另一台机器
And when that hello world appeared on the second windows like so exciting
当这个 Hello World 出现在第二个窗口的那瞬间，就像激动到了极点
I mean if you're a nerd it's really exciting
我的意思是如果你是个书呆子，那真的很令人兴奋
But just the thought that that could have been at any machine right
但只是想到这可能是在任何机器上
That could have been any machine that is just like opens up a whole new world
这可能是任何一台机器，就像打开了一个全新的世界
okay all of our all of our hand-ins are using a system called auto lab
